# Cryptography
Repo for small Cryptography projects. For fun and exercise.

### [One-Time-Pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)
otp.py is a one-time-pad encryption program. You can encode or decode a message using the same security-key of your choice. Encoding and decoding is set by input value.

The code handles numbers, lower- and uppercase letters, and special characters as well. Use security key from the same scale as the message for maximum security. Do not share the security key with others :)
